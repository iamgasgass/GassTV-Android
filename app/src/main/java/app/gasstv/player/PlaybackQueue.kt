 * The ordered channel list the full-screen player can zap through.
 *
 * Set by whatever launches playback (the guide passes the list you were browsing), read by the
 * player for channel up/down and the in-player channel list. A plain in-memory handoff rather
 * than a nav argument, because the list can be thousands of channels — far too big for a URL —
 * and it only needs to survive the hop from the guide to the player.
