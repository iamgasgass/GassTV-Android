 * This is a living-room app: it is looked at in a dark room, from three metres away, often
 * for hours. Bright surfaces and saturated accents that read well on a phone in daylight are
 * actively unpleasant on a 55" panel at night, so everything here is anchored near-black with
 * a single restrained accent used only for focus and selection.
