## stalker_mock.py

A tiny, dependency-free mock **Stalker / Ministra portal** for testing GassTV's Stalker
support without a real provider line. It speaks the slice of the protocol the app's client
calls (`handshake`, `get_genres`, `get_all_channels`, `create_link`) and hands back a few
channels pointing at **free, legal test streams** (Big Buck Bunny, Apple BipBop, Sintel), so
you can exercise the whole path — add source → handshake → channel list → play —
deterministically, and actually see video.

```sh
python3 tools/stalker_mock.py          # listens on 0.0.0.0:8080
python3 tools/stalker_mock.py 9000     # ...or a port you pick
```

It prints the exact values to enter in GassTV (**Add source → Stalker portal**). Point the box
at the machine running it; the control API is served locally, the video comes from public CDNs.
Every request is logged, so you can watch the handshake and each call land — handy when a real
portal misbehaves and you want to mimic it. See the docstring at the top of the file for details.
